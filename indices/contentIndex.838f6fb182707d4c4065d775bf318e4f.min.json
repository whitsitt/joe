I don't think the clothes got too bad but you may have to ask my travel mates. Not having gone skiing in a long time, I didn't realize how sweaty I would get, so if I was to do it again, I would leave those items out in favor of another tee.\n\nAlso, I made a last minute, untested decsision to leave my primary phone charger and adapter at home and just use a short cord that works with my battery bank's wall adapter. **Big mistake**. The cord was too short for airport charging spots and the USB-C would not stay connected to my phone. To charge, I had to connect my battery bank and hold it in my hand with my phone to keep the cord from disconnecting. Charging was slow and painful.\n\nI also regret not taking my packable backpack or my collapsible water bottle. Both of those along with some snacks inside would be great during skiing. I saw a lot of people saving a LOT of money by not succumbing to the high-prices at the mid-mountain lodges.\n\nI thought the coffee mug was a good idea even though it took up a lot of space. I could fill it with water at the airport and it helped me reduce waste. Unfortuantely, the opportunity to grab coffee before skiing was when we were already suited up. Without a backpack, I had no where to put the mug after drinking while skiing. \n\nI saw a lot of people flying in to Salt Lake City with skis, boots and helmets. I am sure if you go a lot, there is a benefit to doing that, but rentals seemed reasonable and convienent.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/2021-boundary-waters-canoe-area-trip":{"title":"2021 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Trip","content":"At the beginning of June this year, I went on a five-night canoe camping trip with family members in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA), specifically the Shell Lake area off entry point 14.\n\nThis was my first canoe trip and my first time visiting the BWCA. Because of that, I had a lot of questions going into the trip.\n\nNormally, on canoe trips, folks have a tendency to pack more similar to a car camping trip because the hikes, or portages, are short and the canoes instead carry most of the weight.\n\nUltimately, I fell back on my lightweight backpacking experience in preparation for the trip.\n\nThe weather forecast was above normal temps with the chance of rain. For the most part we got what the forecast called for but at different times. For most of the trip there was a nice breeze which made the bugs less of an issue, but I still stayed pretty well covered up.\n\n## Packing List\n\n### List\n\n[https://packstack.io/pack/1879/2021-bwca](https://packstack.io/pack/1879/2021-bwca \"https://packstack.io/pack/1879/2021-bwca\")\n\n### Pack\n\n{{\u003c fig src=\"images/pxl_20210608_234932315.jpeg\" caption=\"Knolling my gear for BWCA.\" alt=\"Knolling my gear for BWCA\" \u003e}}\n\n### Worn\n\n{{\u003c fig src=\"images/pxl_20210609_001001886.jpeg\" caption=\"Worn gear for hiking in to first camp.\" alt=\"Worn gear for hiking in to first camp\" \u003e}}\n\n### Food\n\n{{\u003c fig src=\"images/pxl_20210606_025008588.jpeg\" caption=\"My food for the entire BWCA trip.\" alt=\"My food for the entire BWCA trip\" \u003e}}\n\n## Not Pictured\n\nPhone, map, canoe, pfd, paddle and little extra bits like spare zip-locks, silica packets and rope.\n\n## Post-trip thoughts\n\nWith the trip behind me, I do want to record some thoughts about what worked and what didn't and what I might do differently next time.\n\n* **Keens are up to the job** - I love my Keen sandals and thought they would be a good portaging shoe paired with some wool socks. Last minute though, I switched to my trail runners. They were fine, but I think I could have done just fine with Keens. When you don't carry much weight, concerns about ankle support are unfounded.\n* **More food variation** - I had a nutritionally complete vegetarian cold-soak meal plan, but it got old fast when I was eating the same thing every day.\n* **Don't skimp on a bear hang** - I tried to go minimal by using a thinner line and using a tent stake bag as a rock sack. The bag split after several failed throws (duct tape to the rescue) and the line cut into the branches and my hands because I was trying to hang more than two times as much food as I usually do. Also, using an actual pulley instead of a carabiner might be worth the weight.\n* **Camp comforts FTW** - Camp shoes, bug sticks, kindle, hammock porch mode all made for a nice camping experience. Hot coffee goes with that as well but...\n* **Kick the hot coffee habit** - For a basecamp trip, hot coffee and the necessary stove/fuel/mug to do so is worth it, but if I am actively breaking camp each day, cold-soak coffee works just fine and lessens the load.\n* **Consider \"shoulder season\"** - Apparently visiting BWCA during the early spring or early fall should be considered. Though colder, the bugs are less bothersome.\n* **Stop bring the fishing pole** - For two camping trips, I've paid for a fishing license and brought a collapsible fishing pole. I don't like fishing while camping.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nOverall, the preparation all came together nicely and it was a great trip. It was nice to connect with my family in another setting and I hope we do it again someday.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/2022-02-26-move-to-hugo":{"title":"Moved to Hugo from Gatsby","content":"With this post, I can say that I have successfully completed moving my website from [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and in the process did some neat things with it.\n\nFirst off, a quick note about why Gatsby wasn't quite right for this website. [The last move was from Jekyll to Gatsby](hello-gatsby.md) and a lot of what originally drove that transition was getting away from Ruby and starting to investigate decoupled websites as it related to Drupal which I use for work. Well, though I got away from Ruby when it came to this website, I still maintain other Jekyll sites and old Drupal themes built on top of Ruby, so it is still a part of my life. When it came to investigating decoupled websites, I learned that I shouldn't bring my work home. At least for the short term, that kind of work and investigation has been postponed at work and without the need at home, I wasn't motivated to dive into it on my own time. Gatsby is a very versatile tool, but this website doesn't need all of that.\n\nAs for why I chose to move to Hugo, a lot of it is based on Hugo's out-of-the-box nature. I have previous experience getting started with with a Hugo site and the functionality I have come to expect for a blog is already there waiting to be wired up with a couple template snippets. With that said, Hugo only goes so far and I am sure there will be a time when it doesn't go far enough for my liking. Finally, I want to note that the blend of templating, raw HTML/JS and markdown in Hugo is similar to Jekyll and something I prefer over the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and GraphQL type stuff of Gatsby.\n\nOriginally, my thought was just to move things over as fast as I could with a starter theme and then revisit everything down the road but I convinced myself to slow down a bit and approach it how I originally approached Jekyll by building from the ground up. This helped me learn about what Hugo was doing and how to make it do what I wanted it to do.\n\nA big part of the work was cleaning up my old content. Fixing markdown, replacing image markup with a Hugo shortcode, making front matter consistent and accounting for the path changes using Hugo's redirect functionality.\n\nPart of what I wanted to do was to create a theme of my own that didn't have a lot of dependencies, that was easy to update from anywhere and that could score a high, if not perfect, [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) score. I do want to mention that I heavily referenced the [Blonde](https://github.com/opera7133/Blonde) theme before I started down my own path. The Blonde theme does a lot of great things, but things I did not need. It was the Blonde theme that did inspire me to use TailwindCSS which I had not used before.\n\nI could implement [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with the help of [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/introduction/) to compile only what I had styled and none of the extras of the framework that was not needed. This was a big change from my days of Bootstrap where a minified but base styles were loaded everywhere to support the one-off styles I might implement. I have it watching both my theme and my content directories so it only builds the styles based on the classes used. It also removes any styles for the classes I no longer use. I still have an override CSS file available to do this and that, but my overall style footprint is tiny. At the time of writing this, I think my CSS file compressed and minified is only 21 KB.\n\nTo get a solid Lighthouse score you also need to do a lot with your images. Thankfully, Hugo has WebP image processing support now. Instead of creating my own versions locally, I can add a JPEG image to a post front matter and/or somewhere in the post body (using a shortcode) Hugo generates different size/type images for different viewport sizes. This is a huge time saver for me and reduces the need to draft posts on a computer with image processing software. All of this ends up in resources directory which I am tracking in the repository. Later on I plan look into other solutions for asset storage.\n\n\u003e [!INFO]+  Note about Lighthouse scores\n\u003e\n\u003e I am not going to pretend to understand the all of the scoring, but it seems like you have trigger it under very specific conditions. In one run, my scores are perfect, in another I come up just short because I am being _too lazy_ with my image loading that I am now affecting my first contentful paint (FCP) or whatever. That kind of crazy logic tells me to move my blog listing \"below the fold\" which I thought was no longer a thing.\n\nBetween style compilation and image processing, it makes it possible to make updates from anywhere, not just where I have Hugo installed. So, this time around, I have moved this website's repo to a private repository on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/joewhitsitt) and then have [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) build and serve it. Though Gitlab pages works just fine, I am using Netlify because of their free form support in order to maintain a contact form on the website. By going with a private repository, I can leverage Hugo's draft functionality to create posts without them being published and visible right away.\n\nFinally, a lot of these improvements also made it possible to write from anywhere. I can now manage my website from GitLab and Netlify without having to maintain a local environment on my computer. To go a step further, I setup [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) so I can work with content in a nice content management system (CMS) interface. Between that and Gitlab's web interface, I could probably do away with my local environment.\n\nUltimately, I just hope to write more now that a lot of the barriers have been removed. I do plan to make more adjustments to the website (as always), but with 100s across the board on Lighthouse at the moment (When I run it, not when you run it of course), I am going to sit-back and enjoy it for a bit.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/2022-04-03-from-android-back-to-ios":{"title":"From Android back to iOS: Why I bought the new iPhone SE (2022)","content":"The web has had [some harsh words for this phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/tbv8ft/why_do_people_hate_on_the_new_iphone_se_so_much) before it even shipped. Now [Apple is scaling back production based on weak demand](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/28/apple-cutting-iphone-se-production). I had pre-ordered new iPhone SE the morning of March 11th and it was shipped to my home on March 18th.\n\nPreviously, I had been a pretty happy Android user. I first switched over with the Samsung Galaxy SIII way back when and then bought the Google Pixel 2. Both phones treated me well for several years. However, the Pixel 2 was starting to struggle in terms of battery life. Normal old phone stuff. I had been thinking it was time to start looking for a replacement, but I procrastinated as it was still performing relatively well and I was never far from an outlet or my battery bank.\n\nHowever, it was back in February when I was suddenly without a phone. I was zooming down the ski slopes in... Western Illinois when my phone's screen decided to quit. I had mistakenly placed the phone in the \"vent\" pocket of my snow pants. The moisture from sweating must have got to it and it just went blank. When I pulled it out I could hear sounds but couldn't interact with it. People were trying to call me and I couldn't answer. All I could do was perform a hard reboot which ultimately got me nowhere. It was a flashback to when I was young and got separated from my family at a big event. This time, I had to awkward ski boot walk all over the ski resort to find my wife and kids. I nearly turned myself in to resort staff so that they could make an announcement over the loud speaker. \"Come get your husband!\"\n\nAnyway, all of a sudden I was without a working phone. I felt naked. It made me realize how much I depend on my phone every day. I am no stranger to turning my phone off for a bit while camping, but to not have it in my daily connected life was totally different. Our household didn't have any old phones laying around that I could just pop my SIM card into. The biggest issue was I couldn't use text messages for two-factor authentication. I was scrambling through my firebox for backup codes.\n\nThankfully, my brother-in-law came to the rescue with one of his old phones, but it was an iPhone, an iPhone 8. I was very gracious to him for the loaner. I popped my SIM in and after a ridiculously intensive iCloud authentication process I had a working phone again.\n\nIt was a clean break from my Pixel. I didn't have a recent backup of my phone, not that it would have mattered being on an iPhone and my Pixel wouldn't even register when I plugged it into my computer. I did go to the Google Play store to see my installed apps so I could download and set them up on the iPhone. Of course there were a few apps that didn't have an iOS version but I got by.\n\nBesides helping my family with their iPhones, this was the first time in a while that I experienced iOS first-hand. First off, the iPhone 8 was still handling my day to day pretty well. Battery-wise, it wasn't making it through the day, but I was just happy to have a phone. I was also impressed with how a lot of the apps have come along. Apple has been slowly loosening the leash on what apps can and cannot do while still keeping their user's security and privacy in mind. Most noticeably were the improvements to Google apps that had originally sent me to Android. I was deep in the Google ecosystem at the time and the apps were quite limited on my old iPhone. I started to realize that this time around, I could get the best of both ecosystems (Apple vs Google) and that I didn't have to pick just one anymore.\n\nThis came into my mind as I thought about what phone to get next. Part of what had caused me to procrastinate earlier with getting a new phone was that I just wasn't very impressed with the new phones that were coming out. I mean, there are some crazy cool tech out there, but to me, a phone is supposed to be a phone first and I couldn't justify spending that much money for a flagship phone.\n\nAlright, thanks for hanging on this far. Here is why I bought the iPhone SE 2022:\n\n* I needed a phone and I knew from the rumors that a new iPhone was coming if I could just wait a bit. The web insists that people just wait longer for the next one, but I just couldn't.\n* Buying brand new, with the latest chip and basic 5G support makes me think that the phone will be supported with OS update for a good long while. Fingers crossed.\n* While borrowing my brother-in-law's iPhone, I found I could get my git/ssh workflow set up without too much trouble for my Obsidian app, allowing me to capture notes and having them sync to my desktop. \n* I've become hesitant in adopting each new Google feature due to privacy concerns. I am very much still in the Google ecosystem, but I am starting to wonder why the need to have access to certain things all of the time.\n* I felt the pressure to get phone access to the Apple ecosystem whether it be participating in iMessages or approving app downloads for my kids' iPads.\n* I didn't want to spend too much. I am not a photographer that needs the new camera tech. I rarely play games that require processing power.\n* Call me crazy, but I prefer Touch ID over Face ID.\n\nNow a couple things that still bug me about the iPhone:\n\n* The lightning port.\n* I haven't found a suitable replacement for Boost for Reddit app. I am currently using Slide but in my opinion, it comes up short.\n* Speech to text compared to Android is lacking.\n* I miss the ability to dismiss an upcoming alarm without completely disabling it.\n* Safari is the foundation for all browser apps. I use Brave and I suspect that Apple's control over apps is preventing my sync from working properly.\n* I really hate how the home screen places apps in the top left corner. Widgets are cool and all, but I miss being able to fix the apps to the bottom where my hand is so I don't have to reach. The smaller size of the SE makes this less of an issue. Yes, I know about the weird half screen feature.\n\nThere you have it. A long rambling blog post about my recent purchase. Apple, please don't send this phone to an early retirement.\n\n**Update:** I forgot to touch on why I got the 64 GB model. Apparently, that is too small these days for a smartphone. It has been almost a month since I got my phone and I have only used 23.9 GB. I almost immediately sync my photos/videos off my phone, I stream most of my music except for a couple downloaded playlists and I've offloaded the Apple apps I don't use (e.g. Garageband). With the risk of losing or breaking a phone, I cannot justify using phone storage as much as some people do.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/2022-07-08-2022-switzerland-pack-list":{"title":"2022 Switzerland Pack List","content":"I recently had the fortune of going to Switzerland to visit with my friend in and around Bern. Using my friend's place as a home base, we did several bike loops out of Bern, including a few train assisted sections and an overnight trip. There was also several miles of hiking and one day of kayaking down the river Aare. The weather was near perfect (end of May, beginning of June) and my friend was able to double as my translator and the itinerary was light on the touristy sightseeing. On my way back home through Chicago, my wife and kids picked me up and we spent a night downtown near the loop where we introduced the kids to the city before heading home.\n\nIn terms of packing, this was a bit of an oddity for me. Normally, I do a bike trip or an international trip, not both. Trying to pack light enough to carry-on internationally while being prepared for some serious biking made things a bit challenging. Thankfully, I would be renting a bike and borrowing a helmet, but there were still a couple things I needed to be happy and safe on the bike.\n\n{{\u003c fig src=\"images/img_0629.jpg\" caption=\"Knolling my packed items\" alt=\"My Switzerland pack list items laid out for display\" \u003e}}\n\nThough I packed a seat bag for my bike, when I arrived, I found out that my rental came with a handlebar bag. I ended up using this for every ride except for the overnight trip when I lended it to my friend for their bike and used my seat bag instead. I was impressed with the handlebar bag. If I had my own, it would pack a lot better for the trip while still providing the same amount of storage. Both are a pain to get snacks or a phone out while riding, but pair one with a top-tube \"gas tank\" bag or a fanny pack and it would do nicely for an overnight \"credit-card tour.\"\n\nOriginally I was going to bring my own saddle as well, but left it out at the last minute thinking that I would be able to ride whatever was provided. I ended up regretting that decision after the first day of riding. The stock saddle with the rental just didn't align with my sit bones. Next time, I plan to get the measurements ahead of time and decide from there.\n\nThe co-MVPs of the trip were the \"dance pants\" I bought to work as wind pants and my bike mirror. In the evenings after the outdoor activities and when the temperature started to drop, these were my go-to lounge pants. They were also great to wear during laundry loads. The bike mirror just gave me more confidence biking on busy foreign roadways. I've had the mirror since 2012 and has been part of every bike trip since.\n\nThe letdown of the trip were my Inijini wool toe socks. I got them this past winter as a gift and I already have holes in both the big toes. Bummer. Thankfully, I didn't have to rely on them too much.\n\nThere were still things I didn't end up using. The third pair of underwear was probably overkill since I was mostly wearing running shorts and cycling bibs. The weather didn't turn foul enough to make use of the insulated puff jacket or rain jacket. I ended up using my buff for all things bandana and I didn't fill the collapsible water bottle the entire trip.\n\nUsually I am pretty concerned about water availability which is why I brought the collapsible water bottle, however, there wasn't a good way to carry it and most town centers I biked through had water troughs with a separated faucet dispensing a continuous flow of water. I borrowed a spare bike bottle from my friend and between that and my insulated mug had plenty of water throughout the trip. I didn't have to buy bottled water the entire trip.\n\nFor future trips, I think I want to look into a new backpack, perhaps add a handlebar bag to my collection, better headphones, tougher socks and a coin purse for foreign currency.\n\n## Packlist\n\n* The North Face Recon backpack\n* The North Face puff jacket\n* Xero Sandals\n* Outdoor Research Foray Jacket\n* Kleen Kanteen Insulated mug\n* Darn Tough wool hiking socks\n* Inijini wool socks (replaces Smartwool run socks (pictured))\n* Tolietries (allergy meds, toothpaste, tooth brush, soap, vitamins, pain meds, Nuun, Amazing Grass, beard comb, chapstick, floss, deodorant, hand sanitizer, toenail clippers)\n* Sawyer 32 oz with sport cap\n* hacky sack\n* Eagle Creek specter packing cube (medium)\n* Smartwool baselayer long sleeve\n* Smartwool baselayer tee\n* Columbia silver ridge shirt\n* Prana zion slim straight pant\n* plug to usb-a adapter\n* usb-a to lightning cord\n* headphone to lightning adapter\n* headphones (no mic)\n* usb-a to micro-usb\n* usb-a to usb-c\n* battery bank\n* blue ripstop bag\n* Topeak backloader 10L\n* kn95 masks\n* sink stop\n* sunglasses\n* padded bibs\n* padded bibs\n* running shorts\n* board shorts\n* passport\n* Apple iPhone SE 2022\n* wallet\n* Goorin Brothers hat\n* synthetic tee (sleep shirt)\n* synthetic underwear\n* synthetic underwear\n* synthetic underwear\n* sun sleeves\n* Keen cycling sandals with SPD cleats\n* Shimano MTB SPD pedals\n* Giro cycling gloves\n* Buff merino wool\n* bandana (swapped after photo)\n* Smartwool baselayer tee\n* mask\n* earplug pairs x 2\n* flashlight\n* bike light\n* bike mirror\n* Altra lone peak 4.5\n* dress shirt\n* Patagonia r1 hoodie zip\n* Ripstop dance pants (cheap wind pants)\n\n### Not pictured\n\n* scratch paper\n* pen\n* snacks\n* camp pillow (inflatable)\n* paper copies of docs\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/about":{"title":"About","content":"\nI am a web developer focusing on Drupal with the University of Iowa in Iowa City, IA.\n\nI am a husband and father of two.

Our situation has changed enough since I first wrote about budgeting that I didn't feel like it was useful anymore as-is.\n\nThe job, house, wife, kids, dog, car and beer drinking all caught up with me a couple years ago. We were spending more than we were making, forcing us to budget for the first time. Previously, we were lucky to have enough for our lifestyle, but overtime, we were having troubles paying down the debt and money started to become an uncomfortable part of life.\n\nI had finally gone in search of the problem. Spending was high, unexpected expenses kept popping up, and I noticed we were house poor since Abby left her job to raise the kids.\n\nWe tried a few different methods. Mint, a notebook, an online spreadsheet, but none of them really seem to stick.\n\nWhat did seem to work for us was [You Need A Budget (YNAB)](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=9UkrVw89pWW1o_NU\u0026utm_source=customer_referral).\n\nI was not particularly excited about spending money to track money and it was hard to get Abby on board at first but it has stuck and I think it works great.\n\n- The cost actually makes us use it.\n- The phone apps keep the budget handy and up to date.\n- It is really easy to move money around to account for the unexpected.\n- The videos and support articles all drill the method into your head so you know exactly what to do when the next paycheck comes.\n- It actually feels like a game to me which has kept my interest.\n\nWe aren't all of a sudden rich because of it, but I feel like we are more in control of our money and a little less surprised/worried when unexpected expenses pop up.

Heck, it has taken a while for me to even find time to write this post.\n\nA Drupal site is rarely a “set it and forget it” type site. There are updates, security vulnerabilities, tweaks and major releases with weak upgrade paths.\n\nWell, for one of my sites, the [Perineum Falcons (PF) website](//perineumfalcons.com), I decided that Drupal was no longer the best solution and turned to [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com) of all things.\n\nIt was built on Drupal 7, had a few content types, taxonomies, views, a bit of custom code, and the Drupal Bootstrap theme. It was slated to make the move to D8, but I kept putting off the daunting task.\n\nFor simple, low traffic websites like it, maintaining them in Drupal is a hard commitment to make. Ultimately, I decided that Drupal was no longer the best solution for it and turned to Jekyll. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I am excited about Drupal 8, and look forward to working with it more, however, after years of working with Drupal in general, I realize it isn’t always the right tool for the job.\n\nHonestly, another motivation, but not a requirement, was to get all the sites I manage off a shared hosting account that I currently pay for (one of which being the PF site). Who wouldn't like to save a couple dollars per month?\n\nI figured if I could simplify the functionality of the PF site, [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com) which offers free CNAME domain pointing in addition to everything else they offer, could be a suitable place to put it.\n\nWell, was it possible? Of course it was! However, “not all [websites] are the same, and individual results may vary.” I found out that in addition to Jekyll’s posts, pages and front matter, that collections, data files, and the liquid template language, could help me reproduce much of the site. \n\nThe backend was where all the losses piled up in comparison to Drupal. No contest. However, being the primary editor of the site with all of my web savviness, I thought of them more like hurdles and fair compromises than complete functionality lost.\n\nThe one loss that kept coming up while theming the Jekyll site was image processing. The Drupal site different image styles and focal point cropping. For the Jekyll site, I plan to establish a workflow to process images ahead of uploading them to the site. In the meantime I have copied over existing images from the Drupal site and played around with some CSS masking techniques to simulate other image styles. Since I am loading original images, caching is key. To aid with that, I am sending everything through [Cloudflare](//cloudflare.com) which is caching the site.\n\nOne feature for the Drupal site I never got around to implementing was some sort of image/media gallery. Right now, I am using shared [Dropbox](//dropbox.com) folders while I figure out a long term storage/display solution. At least with Dropbox, I am able to crowd source images from each group ride with file requests and move them to a shared folder for viewing.\n\nAnyway, below is a table illustrating the type of content on the site and the conversion I decided upon between the two platforms. \n\n| **Content**   | **Drupal**                             | **Jekyll**                           |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| Blog          | Article Content Type                   | Posts                                |\n| Page          | Basic Page Content Type                | Pages                                |\n| Member        | Custom Content Type                    | Collection                           |\n| Quote         | Custom Content Type (anonymous submit) | Data file (.csv) and Google Forms    |\n| RAGBRAI       | Custom Taxonomy (year based)           | Collection/Data file (.yml) mix      |\n| RAGBRAI Towns | Custom Taxonomy (location based)       | Part of Ragbrai data file.           |\n| Contact Form  | Webform Content Type                   | Formspree.io with validation.js form |\n| Image Gallery | None/Flickr                            | Dropbox Shared Folders               |\n\nBeing a [public repository](//github.com/pfalcons/pfalcons.github.io), you can see the result and all the commit messages that got me there. As of writing this, there are still a few issues/features I want to tackle, but the initial process of converting the site is done.\n\nNow whenever I see a security update email from Drupal.org, I smile knowing that I have one less website to worry about.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/hello-gatsby":{"title":"Hello Gatsby","content":"Jekyll has served me well for several years, but I am interested in trying something new.

Typically for work and this example in particular, most of the attribute information I need to associate with these features are stored elsewhere. Mainly for accessibility purposes, we try to take users away from the map as soon as possible for more information. We also try to have the map data in an accessible listing for those who can't interact with the map.\n\nI also took at shortening the attribute names that I was keeping. These are reprinted over and over, so the less characters the better.\n\n## Compact/Minify\n\nWhite space is bad for file size. Though it helps with readability, unless I need to manually correct data, only parsers will be looking at the raw data.

Based on this year, I made some last minute decisions on what to pack. Here are some factors that changed what ended up on the ride:\n\n* Supported by my team bus.\n* Riding/camping with my wife.\n* Riding my single speed.\n* Only camping four nights (22nd-25th) and only riding three days (23rd-25th)\n\nIn addition, the weather is looking pretty decent for July in Iowa. For the portion that I will be riding the highest is 88 and the lowest is 58.\n\n## Pictured above\n\n_tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, cycling sandals, casual sandals, water bottle, collapsible waterbottle, queen linen sheet, no rinse (2) body wash, sunscreen, gloves, towel, bungies (2), team koozie, deodorant, allergy spray, toothbrush, mirror, headlamp, pain medicine, eye drops, ear plugs, cycling cap, clothes bag, jerseys (3), cycling shorts (2) helmet, button shirt, board shorts, wool tee, running shorts, misc bag, beard comb, toothpaste, spare batteries, chapstick, sunglasses, spork, gorp, food bag, clif bloks (3), clif bars (6), nuun (2), whey protein (3), mini peanut butter, wallet, charger_\n\n## Not pictured\n\n_phone, bagels, bug spray, mini sunscreen, spare tire, assorted zip-ties, mini 15mm wrench, bike multi tool, patch kit, penny, presta valve adapter, CO2 adapter, CO2 cartridge, hand sanitizer, mini rear bike light_\n\n## A few thoughts about what I did and didn’t pack\n\n* Our 3-Person Nemo tent is starting to grow old. Lots of duct tape on the no-see-em mesh.\n* I am not expecting it to be too cold or wet so I am not packing pants, rain jacket, long sleeves, socks. A gamble considering Iowa weather changes quickly. We also tossed our our camp fan in favor of the blanket. See note below.\n* I’ve had these two bottles of No Rinse for quite some time. Time to test it out with my wife around to smell the results!\n* Usually I only carry a travel-sized deodorant, but I think I got a little lazy this year and might need the extra if the No Rinse doesn’t work.\n* Three jerseys instead of the usual two, again in a effort to stay fresh.\n* My wife ran out of space in her bus tub, so I am packing the linen sheet… I believe this is the only thing we have coordinated. Probably could have thought it out a bit more (toothpaste, sunscreen, etc.)\n* I have a rear rack on the single speed this year, so bungies are must just in case for when (not if) I carry a case… of beer.\n* The penny is for toe-in brake adjustments. Something tells me that I will need that and the zip-ties. We will see.\n* Since taking these pictures I have already decided to swap the rear bike light for a bigger/brighter one that uses AAA batteries. Between that and the head lamp, the spare batteries might actually get used this year.\n* The bagels, PB, and whey are all new this year. Trying to save a bit of money by not going to food vendors as often. The blue water bottle has my blender bottle ball in it to mix the whey/water.\n* Our bus has a few other tools, bike pump, solar showers, power outlets, chairs.\n* Yep, no underwear… deal with it.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/ragbrai-xlviii-recap":{"title":"RAGBRAI XLVIII Recap","content":"\n{{\u003c fig src=\"images/pxl_20210727_174939767.jpeg\" caption=\"Knolling my RAGBRAI packlist\" alt=\"My RAGBRAI packlist laid out for display\" \u003e}}\n\nI just got back from another year of RAGBRAI. Wasn't sure if it would actually happen because of the new wave of COVID-19 cases. It was cancelled last year. I only did three and a half days of riding from Parkersburg to Clinton.\n\nOriginally, I was going to bike out to the route and back and meet up with my team, but when my friend Mike said he was going to come all the way over from Switzerland, I adjusted my plans so that I could help him get to the route/team and share any gear with him that he may have needed.\n\nI still kept my gear to a minimum. The weather forecast called for hot days and nights with very little chance of precipitation.\n\n\\** Special note about food/water. I am glad I brought bars, gel blocks, hydration tablets, cold-soak meals. Being a vegetarian on RAGBRAI is still hard to do. On top of that, everything is pricier and in smaller quantities. Water, was scarce when I needed it. I really wished it was more available in the overnight towns. I get done with the ride and want to refill bottles, get a bit extra so that I can recover and start the next day hydrated.\n\n## Packing List\n\n* Bike\n\n* Bike sandals\n\n* Frame pump\n\n* Water bottles (2)\n\n* Rear light\n\n* Helmet\n\n* Bike gloves\n\n* Spare tube\n\n* Patch kit\n\n* Presta adapter\n\n* Multi tool\n\n* 15mm mini wrench\n\n* Sunscreen tube\n\n* Hand sanitizer\n\n* Team koozie\n\n* Cycling cap\n\n* Headlamp\n\n* Sunglasses\n\n* Rear mirror\n\n* Half-frame bag\n\n* Tent\n\n* Sleeping bag liner\n\n* Pillow\n\n* Sleeping pad\n\n* Socks\n\n* Bike shorts\n\n* Bike jersey\n\n* Board shorts\n\n* Merino wool riding tee (2)\n\n* Sun sleeves\n\n* Buff neck gaiter\n\n* Flip flops\n\n* Running shorts\n\n* Hiking shirt short-sleeve\n\n* Sleep tee\n\n* Wipes\n\n* Allergy meds\n\n* Toothbrush\n\n* Toothpaste tabs\n\n* Bug lotion\n\n* Drug/vitamin cocktail\n\n* Wallet\n\n* Phone\n\n* Charger cord\n\n* Charging plug\n\n* Battery cord\n\n* Battery\n\n* First-aid (Neosporin and band-aids)\n\n* Ear plugs\n\n* Chapstick\n\n* Mini pocket knife\n\n* Spork\n\n* Cold-soak jar\n\n* Spare sunscreen tube\n\n* Marker pen\n\n* Zip-ties\n\n* Extra zip-lock\n\n* DIY deodorant\n\n* Trucker hat\n\n* Eye drops\n\n* Soap\n\n* Chamois sheet\n\n### Didn't use\n\nIn addition to the above packing list, I was a bit cautious with my packing plan and added an extra pair of padded shorts, an extra battery pack and a 4L water bladder but didn't use them.\n\n* **Bug spray** - the bugs weren't bad.\n\n* **Vitamins/drugs** - These were in my food bag and I simply forgot about them.\n\n* **Extra merino wool tee** - Packed as an extra riding shirt, I ended up wearing my team jersey twice to represent the team and the other wool tee because it dried enough and didn't smell too bad.\n\n* **Extra sunscreen** - I used the sun sleeves and buff which greatly reduced the amount of skin I was exposing to the sun.\n\n* **Charging cord/plug** - Turned my phone off at night, mostly texting and short calls during the day and a few pictures. The battery pack had plenty left.\n\n### Wished I had brought\n\n* **A long sleeve** - It got colder than expected mainly due to the rain that was also not in the forecast. Originally I had this in the pack list but switched to the short-sleeve hiking shirt. I got by without it, but there was a chill or two I could have done without.\n\n* **Rack/pannier** - Beer storage capable of holding ice while on the ride. I had a backpack instead. It carried the beer alright but it warmed up quickly.\n\n* **Laundry soap/collapsible basin** - Tried to make laundry work with a zip-lock and my regular soap, but it could have been a better experience. The sun sleeves (white) got dirty quick.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nIt hit me this year. RAGBRAI is a celebration of bikes with bike-loving people. It isn't a scenic trip (if you have done it a lot) and it shouldn't be a fitness challenge. I remember sitting at a beer tent in the middle of the route, miles away from the nearest town and thinking about how all of these folks rode out to this farm on their bikes just because and to hang out together and have a beer and maybe some shade. I just thought that was neat. For a while I started to favor other bike trips instead of RAGBRAI, but it really should be in a separate category. Instead I should just factor in how many vacation days I can spare so that I can continue to ride RAGBRAI.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/social-embeds":{"title":"A case against social media timeline widgets","content":"We get it all the time at my work. \"Can I put my Facebook timeline on my website?\"\n\nAbsolutely not. Here is why.\n\n## They are generally inaccessible\n\nAt work, we strive maintain websites that are WCAG 2.0 compliant. Most of these timeline widgets lack the neccessary accomodations to make them accessible to all.\n\n## They don't blend in with your website's look and feel\n\nThey are usually difficult to design around and stick out like a sore thumb unless your site uses the same color scheme.\n\n## All it takes is one bad post to steal the spotlight\n\nIf you timeline is not always 100% on brand, all it takes is one off-message post or retweet to misdirect visitors who take notice. Not all posts are timeless and age well.\n\n## They track you (and are often blocked)\n\nSocial media companies look for ways to get to know you better and these widgets are indirectly another tool they use to do so. They are so good at tracking that browsers, extensions and laws are being created to block them from doing so. This leaves a big blank space on your website for a decent number of your visitors, often your homepage where page real estate is important in capturing your targeted audience.\n\n## Providers change them all the time\n\nSocial media providers change their widgets all of the time which may require updates on your end. Finding, fixing and continuing to maintain these instances can be taxing if used in multiple places.\n\n## Visitors skim right over them\n\nVisitors don't come to your website for social media content. There have been some usability studies that suggest website visitors don't care to scroll through external content and that if they are interested in a website's social media presence, they connect through outbound links on the website or directly through their platform of choice.\n\nWith all of that said, I do see benefits of some social media content within a website.\n\n* Social media links treated like contact information can be a valuable addition a website footer along with other contact methods.\n* Individual Twitter tweets, for example, can serve as visual pull quotes to supplement related content. Just make sure you capture the tweets separately in case the author deletes it or the embed changes/breaks.\n* Offload visitor commentary/discussion to a platform where your visitors already have an account by \"symlinking\" a post. Let the social media companies be your first line of defense against spam and abuse.\n* The basics of SEO on the Internet is creating a web of links. Link back and forth to encourage traffic and crawlers.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/sprucing-up-jekyll":{"title":"Sprucing up Jekyll","content":"\ni finally had a chance to mess with jekyll a bit more and added a few features to the site:\n\n* bootstrap css/js\n* fontawesome\n* archive page\n* disqus comments\n* google analytics\n* categories/tags\n\nfeel free to checkout my [repo](https://github.com/joewhitsitt/joewhitsitt.github.io) to see how i did it all.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/tubing":{"title":"Tubing","content":"\nBelow is some pretty good pointers if you ever find yourself on a river with a tube and beer in hand.

I am not \"saving the day\" again this year by bringing extras, so remember to bring your own.\n\n## Sunscreen/Sunglasses/Hat\n\nSimilar to a sunny September Iowa vs Iowa State football game, you are going to get burned and it won't be evenly distributed.\n\n## Strap Sandals\n\nIt is rocky out there despite all the water, plus broken glass, etc. Straps provide extra traction compared to flip-flops. With that said, most of you won't take this advice and bring a cheap pair of Old Navy flip flops to minimize tan lines. I respect your decision, though I will only point and laugh as your flip flop drifts away down river... I don't recommend aqua socks, old tennis shoes or five fingers because your doggies won't breathe, and will be shriveled raisins by the time we get out of the water. Year after year, folks don't follow this advice, but by the end of the float they agree that it is worth the investment and that I am the wisest man this side of the Mississippi.\n\n## Tents\n\nI am all for folks hunkering in other people's bunkers, and it usually works out in the end, but you should probably talk to the folks you want to sleep with ahead of time. People have also been known to sleep in cars.\n\n## Sleeping bag/blankets/pillow\n\nIt might be too hot at night, but if all else these will help create a buffer between you and a tent mate's pitched tent if you know what I mean.\n\n## Camp Dinner\n\nPast attempts to do this have typically failed miserablly. Arrive early to HyVee and we will attempt to get some food bought evenly and not end up with three of everything. If you want to bring something to share, great! We love you!\n\n## Good luck grilling your pattie\n\nThey don't have grills for the fire pits, so coordinate if you want to bring a camp grill. I usually bring hotdog/smore skewers.\n\n## Waterproof bag or ziplock\n\nIf you are bringing clothing, cash, or other items you don't to get wet down to the river, I suggest not bringing them... Or if you insist, a waterproof bag with a loop or something to latch on to. One year, all this stuff was put in the cooler... Not only was it a bitch to get a beer out, but coolers get tipped and things fall out, sink, and are lost forever. We have a basic car key that I attach to my swimsuit, so everyone else's keys can be locked in our car during the float.\n\n## A large carabiner or hook\n\nThis is a goddamn brilliant idea for hooking up sandals, waterproof bags, waterproof disposable cameras, etc. They also make sunscreen with a carabiner hooked up to it! One year, sandals ended up in the cooler, which tipped. Some sandals were lost, other orphaned sandals were found, and amazingly some how, no one in the group ended up barefoot. This doesn't really make my point to bring a carabiner, but it is still a pretty neat story.\n\n## Flash photography/beats\n\nBesides the group photo, we have had various water resistant cameras make the float. That is fine and dandy, though I recommend not bringing your phone. Do you really trust the $2 waterproof case you picked up from Wal-Mart on the drive up? As for beats, five minutes into the float, everyone is like, oh we should have brought beats for the float like that group over there! A few hours down the float, nobody cares, we have a good time, and it is one less thing for you to worry about. Now crack open another beer and say cheers!\n\n## Water\n\nBelieve it or not, you may need to re-hydrate at some point. Bring some/buy some, otherwise, you might need to bring some burial money.\n\n## Breakfast beer\n\nNo matter how awesome the float/camping gets, please save me at least one ice cold beer for the morning. I won't be able to function/brush my teeth without it.\n\n## Coolers\n\nOnly 40-50 qt coolers (approx. 14x24) are allowed on the float. We need a couple of these based on the number of folks we got going. Let me know if you want to volunteer one. We also need a couple coolers to hold food, water, etc. for back at camp. A side note - Don't get separated from the cooler tube. Trust me, you will get thirsty and grumpy fast.\n\n## Noodles, twine and toes. Oh My\n\nNoodles aren't provided anymore by RnR (lame), and twine is forbidden except for coolers/trash tubes (super lame). I am a firm believer in the \"toe in butt\" solution as it is a great way to bond with each other, but let me know if you have some noodles to use that you don't mind getting cut up and potentially lost. Worse case, Brad can save us anytime we drift more than 5ft apart. The expectations are high Brad. Don't disappoint!\n\n## Firewood\n\nThey sell firewood. Pitch in $2 and we will be good for the night/early morning.\n\n## Earplugs\n\nUnfortunately, as a group, we are getting older and the young kids stay up later than we prefer. Some dicks won't pass out or fall asleep at all... Trying to reason with these assholes in the past have proved to be pointless. There is nothing that will ever de-throne booze and koozies as the most important items to bring, but earplugs come in at a close third.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null},"/vegetarianism":{"title":"So I Became a Vegetarian","content":"My wife heard it from the mayor.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I jumped right into it. I became a vegetarian, but kept it to myself. For breakfast and lunch I didn't share a meal with anyone and I didn't tell my wife about it. \n\nIn the same day my family and I walked to our town's fall festival in the nearby park. The mayor was grilling up hotdogs and was offering them out to anyone nearby. My son walked over and got one so I followed after him to make sure he didn't get ketchup everywhere. The mayor started to hand out another hotdog to me and without thinking I responded, \"no thank you, I am a vegetarian.\" I could have just said, \"no thanks,\" I thought, but I didn't think much more about it. The mayor shrugging my comment off, walked back to the grill and I turned my attention to my son which had ketchup all over his face and hands. Later on, I caught up with my wife. She seemed a bit upset and she pulled me aside. \"I just talked to the mayor, you are a vegetarian now?\"\n\nBack in college, I was a vegetarian for a bit. I basically became one because I didn't like cooking meat. I was living on my own and didn't have a college meal plan so it was my first real experience with grocery shopping and cooking for myself. Cooking meat scared me. I was either afraid I would not cook it enough and get sick or that I would cook it too much, ruin it and possibily set off the building's fire alarm system. I ate a lot of rice and beans but then got even more lazy and started buying rice and bean burritos from Taco Bell. I knew I was nutriant deficent across the board. Eventually I started to get sick more than my friends and realized my diet probably had something to do with it, so I got a meat thermometer and switched back to meat.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I gave up beef for environmental reasons\u003csup\u003e*\u003c/sup\u003e. Beef has a huge enviornmental footprint compared to other proteins.[^1] I was still a firm believer that higher up systematic change was the only way to _really_ have an impact in \"saving the environment\", but between riding my bike to work and cutting out beef, I was \"doing my part.\"\n\nWell, even though I still believe that systematic change will have the greatest impact on saving the environment, the likelyhood of it happening anytime soon in the United States seems farther and farther away. Though I will continue to vote with the environment in mind, voting alone doesn't satisfy my urge to \"do something.\" For me, the next logical step it to cut out meat. Combined with the beef I have already given up, I could potentially shrink my food-related footprint by one-third or more.[^2]\n\nThe next logical step would be to remove dairy and eggs from my diet. I am very vegan-curious and eat vegan a couple times per week and I constantly look up what is and isn't considered vegan. Brown Sugar? Bone char? Really? I am just not there yet. For now, I guess I am considered a \"lacto-ovo vegetarian.\" While in transition, I am doing some rough nutrition tracking to make sure I am still getting the nutrients my body needs.\n\nUltimately, this is me doing something. I see environmental and personal health benefits and I encourage others to consider taking similar steps.\n\n\u003csup\u003e*\u003c/sup\u003e _I gave up beef for the most part. I told myself and others that I would still eat cooked beef if it would otherwise go to waste, and I didn't see the huge environmental impact of eating pepperoni pizza, but that I just wouldn't ever order/buy it myself._\n\n[^1]: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars\n[^2]: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/learning/would-you-change-your-eating-habits-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint.html\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T18:28:17.867722898Z","tags":null}}
