I've been using Obsidian for over a year. It started off as my daily journal that was backed up to a private repo in Gitlab and rendered using Hugo (accessible only by me). I was pretty proud of the setup. The big gotchas were that I had to have frontmatter on all of my content or Hugo would choke. Wikilinks also didn't connect to anything.

As I continued to write my journal entires, I was starting to link to other content and I realized I was forming a second brain. A messy one, but one nonetheless. Some of the stuff I was writing, I turned into blog posts.
