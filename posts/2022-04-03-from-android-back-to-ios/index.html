<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/tbv8ft/why_do_people_hate_on_the_new_iphone_se_so_much rel=noopener>some harsh words for this phone</a> before it even shipped. Now
<a href=https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/28/apple-cutting-iphone-se-production rel=noopener>Apple is scaling back production based on weak demand</a>. I had pre-ordered new iPhone SE the morning of March 11th and it was shipped to my home on March 18th.</p><p>Previously, I had been a pretty happy Android user. I first switched over with the Samsung Galaxy SIII way back when and then bought the Google Pixel 2. Both phones treated me well for several years. However, the Pixel 2 was starting to struggle in terms of battery life. Normal old phone stuff. I had been thinking it was time to start looking for a replacement, but I procrastinated as it was still performing relatively well and I was never far from an outlet or my battery bank.</p><p>However, it was back in February when I was suddenly without a phone. I was zooming down the ski slopes in&mldr; Western Illinois when my phone&rsquo;s screen decided to quit. I had mistakenly placed the phone in the &ldquo;vent&rdquo; pocket of my snow pants. The moisture from sweating must have got to it and it just went blank. When I pulled it out I could hear sounds but couldn&rsquo;t interact with it. People were trying to call me and I couldn&rsquo;t answer. All I could do was perform a hard reboot which ultimately got me nowhere. It was a flashback to when I was young and got separated from my family at a big event. This time, I had to awkward ski boot walk all over the ski resort to find my wife and kids. I nearly turned myself in to resort staff so that they could make an announcement over the loud speaker. &ldquo;Come get your husband!&rdquo;</p><p>Anyway, all of a sudden I was without a working phone. I felt naked. It made me realize how much I depend on my phone every day. I am no stranger to turning my phone off for a bit while camping, but to not have it in my daily connected life was totally different. Our household didn&rsquo;t have any old phones laying around that I could just pop my SIM card into. The biggest issue was I couldn&rsquo;t use text messages for two-factor authentication. I was scrambling through my firebox for backup codes.</p><p>Thankfully, my brother-in-law came to the rescue with one of his old phones, but it was an iPhone, an iPhone 8. I was very gracious to him for the loaner. I popped my SIM in and after a ridiculously intensive iCloud authentication process I had a working phone again.</p><p>It was a clean break from my Pixel. I didn&rsquo;t have a recent backup of my phone, not that it would have mattered being on an iPhone and my Pixel wouldn&rsquo;t even register when I plugged it into my computer. I did go to the Google Play store to see my installed apps so I could download and set them up on the iPhone. Of course there were a few apps that didn&rsquo;t have an iOS version but I got by.</p><p>Besides helping my family with their iPhones, this was the first time in a while that I experienced iOS first-hand. First off, the iPhone 8 was still handling my day to day pretty well. Battery-wise, it wasn&rsquo;t making it through the day, but I was just happy to have a phone. I was also impressed with how a lot of the apps have come along. Apple has been slowly loosening the leash on what apps can and cannot do while still keeping their user&rsquo;s security and privacy in mind. Most noticeably were the improvements to Google apps that had originally sent me to Android. I was deep in the Google ecosystem at the time and the apps were quite limited on my old iPhone. I started to realize that this time around, I could get the best of both ecosystems (Apple vs Google) and that I didn&rsquo;t have to pick just one anymore.</p><p>This came into my mind as I thought about what phone to get next. Part of what had caused me to procrastinate earlier with getting a new phone was that I just wasn&rsquo;t very impressed with the new phones that were coming out. I mean, there are some crazy cool tech out there, but to me, a phone is supposed to be a phone first and I couldn&rsquo;t justify spending that much money for a flagship phone.</p><p>Alright, thanks for hanging on this far. Here is why I bought the iPhone SE 2022:</p><ul><li>I needed a phone and I knew from the rumors that a new iPhone was coming if I could just wait a bit. The web insists that people just wait longer for the next one, but I just couldn&rsquo;t.</li><li>Buying brand new, with the latest chip and basic 5G support makes me think that the phone will be supported with OS update for a good long while. Fingers crossed.</li><li>While borrowing my brother-in-law&rsquo;s iPhone, I found I could get my git/ssh workflow set up without too much trouble for my Obsidian app, allowing me to capture notes and having them sync to my desktop.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve become hesitant in adopting each new Google feature due to privacy concerns. I am very much still in the Google ecosystem, but I am starting to wonder why the need to have access to certain things all of the time.</li><li>I felt the pressure to get phone access to the Apple ecosystem whether it be participating in iMessages or approving app downloads for my kids&rsquo; iPads.</li><li>I didn&rsquo;t want to spend too much. I am not a photographer that needs the new camera tech. I rarely play games that require processing power.</li><li>Call me crazy, but I prefer Touch ID over Face ID.</li></ul><p>Now a couple things that still bug me about the iPhone:</p><ul><li>The lightning port.</li><li>I haven&rsquo;t found a suitable replacement for Boost for Reddit app. I am currently using Slide but in my opinion, it comes up short.</li><li>Speech to text compared to Android is lacking.</li><li>I miss the ability to dismiss an upcoming alarm without completely disabling it.</li><li>Safari is the foundation for all browser apps. I use Brave and I suspect that Apple&rsquo;s control over apps is preventing my sync from working properly.</li><li>I really hate how the home screen places apps in the top left corner. Widgets are cool and all, but I miss being able to fix the apps to the bottom where my hand is so I don&rsquo;t have to reach. The smaller size of the SE makes this less of an issue. Yes, I know about the weird half screen feature.</li></ul><p>There you have it. A long rambling blog post about my recent purchase. Apple, please don&rsquo;t send this phone to an early retirement.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I forgot to touch on why I got the 64 GB model. Apparently, that is too small these days for a smartphone. It has been almost a month since I got my phone and I have only used 23.9 GB. I almost immediately sync my photos/videos off my phone, I stream most of my music except for a couple downloaded playlists and I&rsquo;ve offloaded the Apple apps I don&rsquo;t use (e.g. Garageband). With the risk of losing or breaking a phone, I cannot justify using phone storage as much as some people do.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.whitsitt.org/js/graph.2d9e48dbe7ea47c0ef1c58296ce14448.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Joe Whitsitt using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.whitsitt.org/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/joewhitsitt>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/joewhitsitt>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
